# Seatbelt Warning System Simulation

This project simulates a basic automotive seatbelt warning system using C++. It reflects logic similar to real instrument clusters used in vehicles.

## ðŸš— Features

- Simulates 4 seats in a car
- Takes input for seat occupancy and seatbelt status
- Detects and warns if seat is occupied but seatbelt is OFF
- Designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- C++
- OOP (Classes, Encapsulation)
- Standard Input/Output

## ðŸ§ª How to Compile & Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp Seat.cpp SeatbeltSystem.cpp -o seatbelt
./seatbelt
